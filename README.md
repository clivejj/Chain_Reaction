# Chain_Reaction

This processing sketch by Clive Johnston and Dawei Huang (APCS Period 5) is intended to resemble Mr. Brown Mykolyk's
in-class model. When you initially run this sketch, it would render a multitude of multi-colored balls bouncing about
in random directions on the screen. When the ball reaches the borders, it bounces with the resultant angle equal to 
that of the angle of incidence. If you click on the screen, it starts the reaction and spawns a ball at that spot that
gradually increases in size. Once the normal balls touch that expanding ball, they stop moving and expand at a rate 
similar to that of the initial expansion. Once the ball reaches a certain size, they would stop expanding. The program
stops when all the balls reach this maximum critical size.
